## Resources

### Tools

We do not care what tool you use. Whatever works for you is fine!
Programing, designing, crafting --- pick what you prefer or try
different things. An extensive list of tools can be found at
[Visualising Data](https://www.visualisingdata.com/resources/).

### Data

You are free to pick whatever data you want---we do not provide any
particular dataset for each challenge. Either use the same dataset for
all or different datasets each day, as you like! Search the internet,
collect your own, visualize daily experiences or funny stats.
